      I'm an avid (analog) journaler for organization, productivity, and reflection. You can learn a lot about yourself and personal growth by revisiting years'
      worth of your own logging - you get out of it what you put into it. I log everything from spontaneous to-do lists, various things from my job, daily
      journaling/reflection, notes from articles / books, anything worth writing down - whether meaningful or trivial, etc... If you're familiar with the bullet
      journal, it's similar to that with my own flare. To the naked eye it looks like chaos, but it's very well organized. I use symbols to differentiate
      between different entries and an index in the front of the journal to keep track of the pages those symbols appear - it takes less than 5 minutes at the
      end of everyday to add the page numbers for each type of entry in the index. It's a type of reflection at the end of the day. Now I can go to previous
      years' journals and view specific entries by looking in the index for all the pages those entries might appear (my weight, the cost of gas, daily
      reflection entries, what I did for work that day, etc...).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      The only con or downfall to this method, and the reason I started a create a digital version of it, is you can't easily "search" for entries by keyword or
      visual progress if the types of entries are numeric, dates, or some form of stat. For instance, I want to be able to graph my weight, or the price of gas
      at the time of purchase, or any other type of entry that can indicate status or progress. Plus, what if I want to add photos I took during the day with my
      phone to an entry? Obviously, you can't do that with a physical journal.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      So I set out to create an app that can do all of this. I believe this app will benefit anybody who uses it, regardless of background or profession with
      the ability to customize it to their own needs.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      It may sound somewhat complex, but it's pretty simple. You create the type of entry you want to make in the beginning and record your information with
      that entry. Examples would include a daily journal entry (title, date, free form text field, and possibly image uploads), a daily weight entry (date,
      numeric weight input), etc... It goes a couple steps further with the ability to tag individual entries and organize them into a collection no matter the
      type of entries. If you're an author writing a book, you might have entry types for ideas, citations, website bookmarks, actual chapters, etc... all fall
      under one type of collection you can easily view.
